# CDA&copy; Document Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stav09/clinical-document-library-java.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stav09/clinical-document-library-java)

This is a Java software library that aims to make the generation of Clinical Document Architecture&copy; (CDA) documents easy and encapsulates validation logic to ensure that the result document conforms to the standards outlines by CDA, HL7 v3 and the relevant implementation guide.

This software library contains CDA document Implementation objects (Eg. SharedHealthSummary, EReferral etc); these objects wrap up three distinct models. Each model encapsulates either CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) or SCS (Structured Content Specification) logic.
